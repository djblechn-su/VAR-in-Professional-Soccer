# VAR-in-Professional-Soccer
Repository for my Syracuse Sport Analytics Senior Thesis about the use of VAR in soccer.

### Abstract
After the recent introduction of Video Assistant Referees (VAR) into professional soccer, newfound controversies have arisen regarding the nature of calls made during a given game. Referees and fans alike are allowed to use the instant replay technology to make their own judgements about on field decisions. Many have taken to social media to voice their displeasure about the new technology. This raises the question: "Is it possible to determine whether or not a VAR call is ‘correct’ by using fan sentiment?" Through the use of ESPN commentary and Twitter data, this question can start to be answered. Through my research I hope to analyze VAR decisions in professional soccer to help improve its use in leagues and competitions. Because the use of VAR is quite subjective, I will show that analysis of fan sentiment can be used as a proxy to determine which calls may have been incorrect. There is a lot of work that can be done to improve VAR to make the refereeing of the game as fair and accurate as possible. A better use of this technology can improve television ratings in professional leagues and improve overall fan interest.
